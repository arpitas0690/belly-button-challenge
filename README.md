#Purpose: Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. This dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70 percent of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
